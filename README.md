# ProForm Select for ExpressionEngine 2

### Allows you to select from your ProForm Forms. Can be used in a Matrix Fieldtype or as a standalone fieldtype.

#### Installation

To install this fieldtype, 

1. This fieldtype only works with [ProForm](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/proform-drag-and-drop-form-builder) which you must install first.
2. Place the dt_proform_select directory into ./system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory. 
3. Go to the EE Control Panel (CP) and select Add Ons -> Fieldtypes, then click **Install** in the **Action** column alongside the name DT ProForm Select.  
4. The templates can now be selected as a Fieldtype.
